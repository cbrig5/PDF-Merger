# PDF Merging Script

## Overview

This Python script automates the process of merging multiple PDF files into a single PDF document. It's a quick and convenient solution to streamline the organization of your schoolwork or any other PDF documents.

## Usage

1. **Organize Your PDFs:**

   Place the PDF files you want to merge into a folder. By default, the script expects the PDFs to be in a folder named `pdfs` in the same directory as the script. You can modify the `path` variable in the script to specify a different folder path.

2. **Run the Script:**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python3 merge_pdfs.py
